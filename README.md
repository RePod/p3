A mockup of a calendar from a game about spooky ghosts and high school.    
My old hosting/testing/having fun solution (while also being exposed to the web) up and quit, so now this is here.

Cool stuff used:
 - *jQuery* and *jQuery UI* (really bloats the repo, original plans were ambitious to make something full fledged)
 - *Font Awesome* for 99% of the UI, allowing meaningful and understood interactions
 - *[DateJS](http://www.datejs.com/)* for making managing time with relative units extremely easy
 - *[SunCalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc)* for doing the same as above, except for phases of the moon
 - The *[TS Block font](http://www.dafont.com/ts-block.font)* which looks really good (see: the digits)
 - *Arimo* (Google Fonts) for the rest of the *calendar's* text (see: not the digits).

Things I regret:
 - Spawning all the date placeholders at once into one huge container element
   - It was a stop-gap solution to deal with populating them dynamically
     - I was also considering dragging the container horizontally
   - The end result isn't too bad or demanding, just ugly
 - Not using Orpheus until the end

DateJS made a lot of things easier.
SunCalc made moon phases possible without an external source.

Arimo is a near similar, free alternative to the original fonts.
